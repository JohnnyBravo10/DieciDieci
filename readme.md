## Rules

Every turn three pieces are offered to the player, who has to place them in the 10x10 tiles game board without putting them above a tile of a previously placed piece. The player earns 1 point for every tile composing the pieces he posits on the board. If after a piece is placed on the board all the tiles of a row or a column are occupied this line is fully emptied and the player earns 10 points. The game terminates when none of the proposed pieces can be placed on the board.
